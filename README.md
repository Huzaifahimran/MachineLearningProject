# Machine Learning Project

Welcome to Customer Churn Prediction This repository contains a project that includes an API and a GUI model for predictive analysis.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:
## Note:Run this in a windows environment using CMD as your terminal or the tkinter library might produce issues in linux unless you know how to install tkinter.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Huzaifahimran/MachineLearningProject
   cd MyProject
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment in the repository folder:
   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .\myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```

4. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Run the API file:
   ```bash
   python api.py
   ```

6. Open a new terminal (cmd) without closing the terminal in which your API file (api.py) is running.

7. Activate the already created virtual environment in this second terminal:
   ```bash
   .\myenv\Scripts\activate
   ```

8. Run the GUI APP file:
   ```bash
   python guiformodel.py
   ```

9. Now you can enter your data for the model to predict.
